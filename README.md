# RandomizeGladeAccess

Randomizer 4 connection I threw together as a first HK mod project.
Adds an item to the randomization pool that replaces the vanilla method of opening Spirit's Glade.

It can be toggled, along with a dupe option, in the connections menu. For split group stuff it should end up
in the same pool as Elegant Key.

Big thanks to [flibber-hk](https://github.com/flibber-hk) for documenting how to make rando connections and making several good ones to yoink code from, as well as everyone else who worked on the Rando/ItemChanger API.
